## Introduction

This project is part of the module **UX/UI Design** for [HackYourFuture Belgium](https://hackyourfuture.be/).

The main objective is to learn about *Design Thinking* and *User Empathy* by designing a home page for my partner and developing my own home page based on her design.


## Learning goals

-  **Week 1**

   Practice User Interviews and Design Thinking by working in pairs to come up with a new Home Page.

-  **Week 2**

   Learn to use Figma for planning websites.

   Practice solo development by turning my backlog into my new Home Page.

   Learn about open source libraries by choosing and using a CSS Framework in my project.
